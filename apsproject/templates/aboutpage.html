            <h1 align="center">Why Astrology?</h1>
            <p>Astrology is a predictive science with its own sets of methods, claims and findings that have forever inspired and allowed people with insights into different aspects of their life.Astrology, with its wows and hows, is contentful and approving enough to make people a believer of the same. And thankfully, it continues to do so despite the world shifting bases from what they believe in and what they don’t.</p>

            <p>If one has to go into the technicalities of astrology, it is the study of different cosmic objects, which are usually stars and planets, that have an effect on the lives of the people. You must be aware that there are as many as 8 planets in the solar system. However, If I ask an online astrologer near me about the planets in astrology, they will tell me that there are as many as 9 planets in astrology also called Navagrahas. And surprisingly, the planet Earth, in astrology, is not counted among the nine planets.</p>

            <p>The 9 planets in astrology are Sun (Surya), Moon (Chandra), Mars (Mangala), Mercury (Budha), Jupiter (Brihaspati), Venus (Shukra), Saturn (Shani), Rahu (north node of the moon), and Ketu (south node of the moon).</p>

            <p>Among these planets, some planets are called friendly planets, meaning the presence of them brings positivity to your life. And then, there are also planets that have a negative influence on humans. The latter would be planets like Rahu and Ketu. Their presence in one’s Kundli is said to bring pain and misery. However, there is another aspect one needs to be aware of. It’s the fact that the presence of Ketu in one’s horoscope is not always bad and similarly, the presence of Jupiter in one’s Kundli might not be the best every time.</p>

            <p>It all depends on which houses these planets are sitting in. If you ever had the opportunity to talk to an astrologer online, then s/he must have told you about houses in astrology and the movements of planets in the same. There are as many as 12 houses in Kundli. And all of these houses represent one thing or the other. You can check your free kundali online.</p>

            <p>For example, the first house, which any online astrology consultation would tell you is also the ascendant of the person, is the house of self. It represents a person’s personality and physical traits. Similarly, the fifth house in the Vedic horoscope, also known as Putra Bhava is the house of creativity, playfulness, joy, pleasure, and romance. If, for example, a good planet, like Jupiter, is camping in the fifth house, your love life will excel. Likewise, if Rahu is camping in the same house, then you might feel the need for online astrology consultation to deal with the woes.</p>

            <p>Then there are other things in astrology like elements, the Moon sign of an individual, numerology, tarot and so much more that is impossible to wind up here.</p>

            <p>First of all, the credit for astrology and the predictions we make here being so accurate goes to the 100s of learned and astrologically-versed astrologers we have on board.And to answer what makes astrology so accurate, then it is the pure knowledge of our astrologers about the planets, planetary configurations, constellations and learning of how they influence human life and behaviour as they move, shift or even stay still. Astrology is not some random guesswork but science that entails scientific principles that were sketched by learned Gurus 1000s of years ago and have not changed to date. These gurus studied the movement of planets and how their aura influences the life of people on earth.

            <h2>How much does Astrotalk cost?</h2>
            <p>Simply put, Astrotalk suits your budget.And if you consider the First Chat Free feature, then it will definitely suit your budget. On Astrotalk, a user can get services at as low as Rs 10 per minute to Rs 250 per minute. The astrologers on Astrotalk charge as per their experiences, both in personal life and their time on the app. So it doesn’t mean an astrologer who is charging low is not good. It could simply mean that he/she may have just started on the app and thus want to keep his/her price affordable for the user. Interestingly, some astrologers deliberately keep their consultation prices low as their prime motive is to only help others with their talent. In a nutshell, you will find both affordable and not so budget-friendly astrologers on Astrotalk but at the end of the day, all of them are best at what they do as they have been scrutinised by the expert astrologers before they make it to the app.
